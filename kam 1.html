	<h1><b><center> Mission For Futher </center></b></h1>
	<p>I will live each day as though I had all the power and influence necessary to make it a perfect world. Through listening to and serving others, I will learn new ideas and gain different perspectives. I will strive to gain mastery over life’s challenges through increasing my circle of influence and de-emphasizing those areas of concern over which I have no control.

		I will behave in a manner so as to become a light, not a roadblock, for others who choose to follow or lead me. I will trust my dreams and be the prisoner of nothing. I will use my private victories unselfishly by trying to create value for others. The pursuit of excellence will determine the options I decide to exercise and the paths I choose to travel. I will expect no more of others than I expect of myself.
		
		I will seek new sources for learning and growth – nature, family, literature, new acquaintances. I will show love rather than expect love. I choose to focus upon being effective versus efficient. I choose to make a difference in this world.</p>
